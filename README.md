# Tansa: LAN service discovery over IPv6 multicast

[![codecov](https://codecov.io/github/seamlik/tansa/graph/badge.svg?token=AH6YGZOMJM)](https://codecov.io/github/seamlik/tansa)

This project is an opinionated solution of multicast discovery.
Written in pure Rust, it is [cross-platform](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html) and is suitable to be a unified and portable solution for an application planning to span all major devices like laptops, smartphones and more.

This project offers both a crate and a CLI application.
However, I will not publish it to any public registry since it is highly experimental.

## Project name meaning

Based on Japanese 探索 with pronounciation "tansaku" meaning "discovery".
